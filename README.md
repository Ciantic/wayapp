# Wayapp

No winit was used during creation of this thing.

This repository aims to not use cross-platform libraries for handling windows, instead it uses just wayland APIs via Smithay's libraries. If you target just Linux then adding cross-platform overhead is not necessary.

## EGUI

Currently uses only EGUI WGPU rendering.

## ICED

I don't know will I ever get to ICED integration, but it is planned.
